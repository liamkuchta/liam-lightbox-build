## Liam's Survivor Lightbox's

I changed all the photos to different survivor conestants, and created 2 more. I changed the background and the visual styling of it to hard-light. I changed the color theme and added the survivor logo. I added bio photos for every contestant with the right dimensions. I made sure all of the lightbox images are the same dimensions.

## Why survivor is one of the greatest shows

Survivor throws people of all walks of life into a place that's usually out of their element so it's interesting to watch. You get to see the way some very different types of people would work and interact with eachother if they ever came together - people who probably wouldn't come together outside of the show. In the first week everybody has masks on and are just trying to keep their cool with eachother. As time goes by you see them start to lose their patience and drop the act and their real colours start to show. The illimination challenges are amazing, more-so in the older seasons.
